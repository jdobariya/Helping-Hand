#Introduction

Welcome to the world of Helping Hand, a web application that aims to bring people together for a greater cause. In this project, we will be developing a website that serves as a platform for individuals to organize and participate in events for public welfare. The website will also facilitate crowdfunding for these events, enabling people to contribute to causes they believe in. The core value of this platform is to encourage volunteerism and to empower individuals to make a difference in their community. We believe that Helping Hand has the potential to create a significant impact, and we are excited to embark on this web development project.
